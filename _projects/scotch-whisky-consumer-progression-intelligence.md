## Overview
This case study looks at how Scotch whisky shoppers move from familiar accessible bottles into more distinctive premium expressions, and where that movement gets helped or interrupted by price, packaging, and shelf presentation.

## Business Context
Premiumization in Scotch is rarely a clean straight line. A shopper might browse upward, buy a bottle as a gift, flirt with something more premium on a feature display, then fall back to what still feels safe. That means category teams need something more grounded than sales totals if they want to understand real progression.

## Problem Statement
The commercial problem is not simply whether premium Scotch is selling. It is whether the shelf is creating believable movement upward, where price jumps start to feel uncomfortable, and which products are acting as gateways versus long-term preference bottles.

## Analyst Objective
Build a product intelligence case study that reads progression through product role, shelf conditions, gifting cues, and sparse repeat behaviour, then turn those patterns into commercial decisions a retail or category team could actually use.

## Stakeholders
- Category and commercial teams deciding how to structure the Scotch ladder.
- Merchandising teams reviewing where premium bottles should sit on shelf.
- Brand teams trying to separate trial-driving packs from loyalty-driving bottles.
- Retail strategy teams needing a more believable view of premiumization friction.

## Key Questions
- Which bottles act as gateway products into a more premium Scotch journey?
- Which bottles behave more like destination products once preference becomes clearer?
- Where does price progression start to tighten?
- Does gift packaging widen trial without building much loyalty?
- Which display conditions drive discovery, and which ones support repeat?

## Analysis Logic
- Entry bottles should dominate raw frequency without automatically becoming loyalty leaders.
- Premium and distinctive bottles should pull average value upward while remaining lower-frequency.
- Gift cues should help trial and occasion-led purchase more than they help repeat.
- Feature-led visibility should recruit discovery, while standard shelf conditions should show more of the loyalty pattern.
- The dataset should stay slightly messy so the progression story feels observed rather than fabricated.

## Approach
- Designed a synthetic Scotch retail dataset with 3,200 observations across eight fixed expressions.
- Modeled product, shelf, display, promo, gifting, and buyer-stage signals with imperfect correlations.
- Exported a compact set of visuals focused on progression, friction, loyalty, and stalling points.
- Built a notebook and a portfolio-ready walkthrough that keeps the tone commercial and human.

## Insights
- Johnnie Walker Black Label emerges as the strongest gateway bottle in the final build.
- Lagavulin 16 behaves most like a destination product: smaller in frequency, stronger in commitment.
- The biggest modeled price friction appears in the R320-R420 step-up zone.
- Gift packaging helps reach and occasion buying more than it helps repeat.
- Standard shelf execution still matters if the real goal is loyalty rather than spectacle.

## Deliverables
- Synthetic Scotch retail dataset
- Notebook for progression and premiumization analysis
- Exported visuals for tier mix, product role, pricing friction, gifting, display impact, and stalling points
- Written insight file for commercial takeaways
- Embedded case walkthrough inside III.IV

## Results
- The build lands at 3,200 retail observations.
- Entry and core bottles still carry most of the category traffic.
- The strongest gateway product is Johnnie Walker Black Label.
- The strongest destination product is Lagavulin 16.
- The clearest progression friction sits in the R320-R420 jump.

## Recommendations
- Use familiar step-up bottles as the visible bridge into premium Scotch rather than relying on abrupt jumps.
- Treat gift packaging as a recruitment tool, not proof of loyalty.
- Protect the standard shelf for repeat-friendly bottles even when feature displays are doing discovery work.
- Make the first premium price stretch easier to understand with clearer comparison and flavour cues.
