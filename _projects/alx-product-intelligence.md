## Overview
ALX Data Science: Learner Progression & Completion Intelligence is an EdTech product analytics case study built around the structure of a guided, cohort-based data science programme. The work focuses on where learner momentum breaks, how assignment strain changes dropout risk, and which learner patterns deserve earlier intervention.

## Hero
EdTech product analytics case study focused on retention, progression, completion, and dropout pressure in a sprint-based learning programme.

## Intelligence Layer
A cohort programme does not fail in one place. Pressure builds through onboarding, pacing, device constraints, assignment deadlines, and middle-stage fatigue. This case joins those signals so the programme team can act earlier and more precisely.

## Problem
The core problem is not low content usage by itself. It is the lack of a joined-up view across weekly lesson progress, sprint pressure, assignment behavior, and final learner status. Without that, teams can see that completion is weak without clearly seeing where the breakdown starts.

## Data / Signals
### Analyst Objective
Build a decision-ready learner intelligence layer that helps teams:
- track retention by cohort,
- isolate the sprints where dropout clusters hardest,
- measure how engagement and assignment behavior change completion odds,
- and identify where learner support should intervene first.

### Stakeholders
- Product teams improving learner experience and platform support.
- Programme teams managing cohort pacing and intervention timing.
- Academic leads reviewing sprint load and assignment design.
- Leadership teams tracking completion and learner risk across intakes.

### Key Questions
- Where do cohorts lose the most learners over time?
- Which sprint carries the heaviest single drop-off?
- How strongly does steady weekly engagement improve completion?
- When late work rises, how much more vulnerable does the learner become?
- Which device patterns need different support or design?

### KPI Framework
- Cohort health: retention curves, completion rate, active rate.
- Progression: weekly completion movement, sprint-level drop-off.
- Engagement: time on platform, lesson completion rate, engagement bands.
- Assignment health: submission rate, lateness, score, dropout gap.
- Learner risk: device pattern, employed-learner pressure, dropout reason mix.

## Insight
- The modeled programme covers 538 learners across 10 cohorts, with a 46.7% dropout rate and a 46.1% completion rate.
- Sprint 4 carries the heaviest single drop cluster, but one third of all dropouts still happen by week 6.
- Mobile-only learners complete 16.3 percentage points less often than desktop learners in this run.
- High lateness lifts dropout by 27.2 percentage points versus low-lateness learners.
- 57.8% of week 6 to 10 dropouts come from employed learners, which points to middle-stage schedule pressure.

## Implication
- Onboarding still needs structured support, even though Sprint 4 is the sharpest single spike.
- Late work should be treated as an early intervention signal, not only an academic admin issue.
- Mobile learning needs lighter and clearer support for assignment-heavy weeks.
- Employed learners appear to need more flexible pacing or better week 6 to 10 guardrails.

## Closing
### Deliverables
- Synthetic learner, cohort, progress, assignment, and dropout datasets.
- Pandas-based analysis for retention, sprint pressure, assignment health, and completion risk.
- Exported charts and documented notebook for stakeholder storytelling.
- Hosted walkthrough report plus readable GitHub project documentation.

### Outcome
The case demonstrates how EdTech analytics can move beyond activity reporting into a clearer learner-intelligence view that is more useful for retention and programme decisions.

### Recommendations
- Strengthen onboarding support in the first two sprints.
- Escalate late work into earlier learner intervention.
- Review Sprint 4 workload and checkpoint design.
- Improve mobile support for assignment-heavy phases.
- Add targeted pacing support for employed learners during weeks 6 to 10.
