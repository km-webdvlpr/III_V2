## Overview
Capitec: Consumer Fintech Ecosystem Adoption Intelligence is a product analytics case study built around the public shape of a large consumer fintech ecosystem. The work focuses on how users move from basic banking activity into deeper product use, which attach paths are easiest to grow, and where repeated failure starts to damage trust.

## Hero
Fintech product analytics case study focused on digital activation, ecosystem depth, retention, and failure-led churn risk.

## Intelligence Layer
High customer numbers do not automatically mean strong ecosystem adoption. The more useful question is whether digitally active users are becoming primary-banked, multi-product, and durable over time. That is the layer this case is designed to surface.

## Problem
The core problem is not account growth. It is the lack of a joined-up view across digital activity, transaction behavior, product attach, support pressure, and retention. Without that, teams can push cross-sell too early, miss trust breakdowns, and overestimate how many customers are actually moving into deeper ecosystem use.

## Data / Signals
### Analyst Objective
Build a decision-ready fintech intelligence layer that helps teams:
- read the adoption ladder from opened account to deep ecosystem use,
- identify which products are easiest to attach after core banking,
- measure how product depth changes retention,
- and quantify how repeated transaction failure affects next-cycle churn.

### Stakeholders
- Product teams improving activation, self-serve use, and feature adoption.
- Growth teams deciding where cross-sell effort should land first.
- Retention and CX teams tracking trust friction before it becomes silent churn.
- Leadership teams reviewing whether ecosystem growth is durable or shallow.

### Key Questions
- How many users move from basic account ownership into digital and primary-banked behavior?
- Which non-core products are the easiest next attach for active customers?
- How strongly does retention improve as product depth increases?
- When transaction failure repeats, how much more vulnerable is the next month?

### KPI Framework
- Activation: digitally active rate, primary-banked rate, adoption ladder progression.
- Ecosystem depth: 2+ product rate, deep ecosystem rate, attach rates by product.
- Retention: 30-day retention, 90-day retention, retention by product depth.
- Trust friction: failed transaction exposure, support-contact rate, next-month churn gap.

## Insight
- The modeled ladder moves 15,000 opened accounts into 9,791 digitally active users, 8,988 digitally active primary-banked users, and 2,035 deep ecosystem users.
- `value_services` is the easiest non-core attach product among primary-banked users at 54.4%, ahead of savings at 38.5%.
- Deep ecosystem users retain at 63.9% over 90 days versus 22.3% for core-only users.
- Repeat failure months raise next-month churn from 32.5% to 41.5% and lift support-contact rate from 4.7% to 32.7%.

## Implication
- The strongest growth path is not broad cross-sell. It is moving digitally active, primary-banked users into the first practical add-on products that are easiest to trust and reuse.
- Product depth is not only a reporting number. In this model it behaves like a strong loyalty signal.
- Repeated payment failure should be reviewed as a weekly product risk, not only a support queue issue.
- Trust protection matters because failure-heavy months weaken the next cycle even when overall activity still looks healthy.

## Closing
### Deliverables
- Synthetic Capitec-shaped datasets across users, logins, transactions, product usage, balances, and support events.
- Pandas-based analysis for activation, product attach, retention, and failure impact.
- Exported CSV outputs, documented notebook, and visual storytelling assets.
- Hosted walkthrough report plus structured GitHub project documentation.

### Outcome
The case demonstrates how consumer fintech analytics can move beyond usage counts into ecosystem intelligence that is more useful for product, growth, and retention decisions.

### Recommendations
- Prioritize savings and value-services journeys for digitally active primary-banked users.
- Track product depth as a leading signal of durable customer value.
- Flag repeated transaction failure into a weekly trust review.
- Treat next-month drop-off after failure as a product health KPI, not only a CX metric.
